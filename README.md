**Master the art of concurrency, parallel programming, and memory management to build fast Delphi apps**

## What is this book about?
Performance matters! Users hate to use programs that are not responsive to interactions or run too slow to be useful. While becoming a programmer is simple enough, you require dedication and hard work to achieve an advanced level of programming proficiency where you know how to write fast code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get to grips with algorithmic complexity and learn how to recognize it
* Use tools to determine program runtime behavior
* Speed up programs by doing less instead of more
* Discover the internal workings of Delphi data structures
* Gain an understanding of Delphi’s memory manager
* Find out how to write low-level parallel programs with TThread
* Use parallel patterns from the PPL and OTL libraries to write fast code
* Include external code, written in C or C++, in Delphi programs

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter05.

The code will look like the following:
```
{$IFOPT O+}{$DEFINE OPTIMIZATION}{$ELSE}{$UNDEF OPTIMIZATION}{$ENDIF}
{$OPTIMIZATION ON}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for all Delphi programmers. Whether you’re a beginner or an accomplished programmer, you will find something interesting. Even though the focus is on the latest Delphi release, the code uses only standard Delphi syntax without syntactic additions from the latest releases, and most of it should compile and run in any Delphi from XE7 onward. If you’re using an older version of Delphi, don’t despair! Most of the concepts in this book do not depend on a specific Delphi version and will be useful for everyone.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-11 | Embarcadero RAD Studio or Embarcadero Delphi (11.3 or  | Windows |
| 1-11 | Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 |  |

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/GLK5S).

## Get to Know the Author
**Primož Gabrijelcic**
 started coding in Pascal on 8-bit micros in the 1980s and he never looked back. In the last 20 years, he was mostly programming high-availability server applications used in the broadcasting industry. A result of this focus was the open sourced parallel programming library for Delphi—OmniThreadLibrary. He's also an avid writer and has written several hundred articles, and he is a frequent speaker at Delphi conferences where he likes to talk about complicated topics, ranging from memory management to creating custom compilers.
